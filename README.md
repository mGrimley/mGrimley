As the founder of a small business and a full-stack developer, I love learning how to solve problems. If I ever hit an obstacle I canâ€™t overcome yet, I know I have the skills required to quickly learn how. From SQL database management to CAD software to even recipe optimization, there isnâ€™t anything I canâ€™t quickly gain a thorough understanding of.
